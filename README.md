TaleXMPP
========

Talexmpp is an XMPP shim for [Talek](https://github.com/privacylab/talek).

It runs as a local XMPP server, which transforms XMPP messages into actions
taken by a talek client to chat with remote contacts without revealing social
network information to the servers.

A getting-started page is maintained [here](https://wills.co.tt/talexmpp).
